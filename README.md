# pyscf_mbe_pol

A fragment-based approach using many-body expansion (MBE) theory is used for the  QM calculation of liquid water. 

BIM (binary interaction method) had been used for the following paper:
S. Y. Willow, M. A. Salim, K. S. Kim, and S. Hirata, "Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics of Liquid Water Using Embedded-Fragment Second-Order Many-Body Perturbation Theory Towards its Accurate Property Prediction," Sci. Rep. 5, 14358, (2015).

MBE_POL is a modified MBE method by adding polarization energy into MBE.
